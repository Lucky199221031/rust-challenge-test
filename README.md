# rust-challenge-test

## Requirement

The challenge is to return the minimal amount of meeting rooms needed a day given the interval times of those meetings. 
So, if you have meetings from 1 to 4, 2 to 5 and 7 to 9, the minimal amount should be 2 rooms given the first and second meeting overlap.
 
Half-open interval is that the end of the interval is not considered within it. For instance: 1-4, the meeting would end at 4 and not at 4.59
